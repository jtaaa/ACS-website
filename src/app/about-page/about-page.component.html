    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      In the Association of Caribbean Students weâ€™re all about keeping the 
      Caribbean community at U-Waterloo strong and sharing the love by hosting
      events and educating the wider university population about the diversity
      and beauty of our culture.

    <!-- <p>
      Within ACS, students born in the Caribbean will be able to experience and
      enjoy an atmosphere in which they can relax and feel at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students not born in the Caribbean, but with Caribbean background will find a place
      where they can find out more about their ancestry, homeland and culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students with no Caribbean background will have the opportunity to
      discover more about a unique culture and participate in activities and
      events that they might not have otherwise been able to experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ACS provides entertainment and educational value to students of all backgrounds
